# CPP_Practice

This is a collection of practice programs I created in C++ to demonstrate different uses and scenarios. Each folder is its own program individually.

## Backend:
- `.cpp` C++ v.C17
- `.h` headers

## Tools:
- Git and GitHub for version control
- Replit for web-based editing
- Visual Studio Code for local editing
